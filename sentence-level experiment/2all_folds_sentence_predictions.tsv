But I saw nothing.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Take your pistol, and we will enter Dr.  Roylott's room.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
She is waiting now in the sitting-room.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL

"""By no means."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Dark enough and sinister enough."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Oh, yes, I did."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""You see it, Watson?"" he yelled."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""You see it?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It was a singular sight which met our eyes.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr.  Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,"" said he, ""but it's the common lot this morning."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""My name is Sherlock Holmes."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""It is not cold which makes me shiver,"" said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is fear, Mr. Holmes."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""There is no mystery, my dear madam,"" said he, smiling."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Your sister is dead, then?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Perfectly so."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""'No, I have not."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""He is a hard man,"" she said, ""and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""But what, then, did the gipsies do?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""See that you keep yourself out of my grip,"" he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""He seems a very amiable person,"" said Holmes, laughing."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I have seen the will of the deceased wife,"" said he."	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""There is some building going on there,"" said Holmes, ""that is where we are going."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""There's the village,"" said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; ""but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"There it is, where the lady is walking."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"There are windows in it, of course?"""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""Where does that bell communicate with?"" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""That is also quite modern,"" said the lady."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""What's in here?"" he asked, tapping the safe."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Ah, yes, of course!"	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"That is quite settled,"" said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""That is not quite so common, is it?"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I believe that that is the village inn over there?"""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.  Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Does not that strike you?"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""The lady could not move her bed."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Subtle enough and horrible enough."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""That is the baboon."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I nodded to show that I had heard.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""It means that it is all over,"" Holmes answered."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""And perhaps, after all, it is for the best."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What, then?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
The marks are perfectly fresh.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
It was from her that I had your address.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I think it was before your time, Watson.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
She had a considerable sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""And why?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""One moment,"" said Holmes, ""are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound?"	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"Could you swear to it?"""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Yes, all."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"What are you going to do yourself?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Which of you is Holmes?"" asked this apparition."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Holmes chuckled heartily.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I thought it as well,"" said Holmes as we climbed the stile, ""that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""All has turned out splendidly."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Dr.  Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"I remember that it was full of papers."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""There isn't a cat in it, for example?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Well, look at this!"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""No, we don't keep a cat."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""The rest you will leave in our hands."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"There is a distinct element of danger."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr.  Roylott's cigar.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""But what harm can there be in that?"""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""I cannot as yet see any connection."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"The speckled band!"" whispered Holmes."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What is it, then--a fire?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""No; a client."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Good-morning, madam,"" said Holmes cheerily."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Ha!	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"It is terror."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""'Never,' said I."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Indeed,"" said Holmes."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I knew that it was my sister's voice.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""He investigated the case with great care, for Dr.  Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""But have you told me all?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"You are screening your stepfather."""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"Will you not wait and breakfast?"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I see many objections to any such theory."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Indeed, Doctor,"" said Holmes blandly."	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
My stepdaughter has been here.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""I know you, you scoundrel!"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Your conversation is most entertaining,"" said he."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
It may stop his gossip.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Good heavens!"" she cried, ""he has followed me, then."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"What will he say when he returns?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
That is suggestive.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Won't it ring?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"I never noticed that before."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Let me explain.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Your windows would be visible from there?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"" said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""Perhaps I have."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

"""No."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,"" said she."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Farintosh,"" said he."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The speckled band!'	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Yes, there are nearly always some there."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Why, what do you mean?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I have traced her.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
You must lock yourself up from him to-night.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"Too narrow for anyone to pass through."""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""No, it is not even attached to a wire."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

"""It is very kind of you."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
How long they seemed, those quarters!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I took a step forward.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Such are the true facts of the death of Dr.  Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Alas!"" replied our visitor, ""the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Pray be precise as to details,"" said he."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""'Very likely."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""Always."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""How about poison?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Miss Roylott, you have not."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""This is a very deep business,"" he said at last."	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Yet we have not a moment to lose.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""And you may expect us early in the afternoon."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""And what do you think of it all, Watson?"" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"But what in the name of the devil!"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What has she been saying to you?"" screamed the old man furiously."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"You put me off, do you?"" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop."	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
I have heard of you before.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Pending the alterations, as I understand."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""There were none."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Ah!"	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Yes, but very small ones."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
This is very interesting.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""How very absurd!"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"But I don't know why it should be tied."""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Ah, me!	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Very good."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""You speak of danger."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I imagine that you saw all that I did."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I cannot say that I have."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:  ""The least sound would be fatal to our plans."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.  Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""'Certainly not."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I could not sleep that night."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It was the band!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
That is important.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Excellent."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""Pray take a seat."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""It is a little cold for the time of the year,"" said Holmes."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Ha!"	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""Holmes, the busybody!"""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"See here."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr.  Grimesby Roylott,"" remarked the driver."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""It goes to the housekeeper's room."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Done about the same time as the bell-rope?"" remarked Holmes."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"What a strange idea!"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Your life may depend upon your compliance."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""Holmes,"" I cried, ""I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""My God!"" I whispered; ""did you see it?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
All was as we had seen it in the daytime.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"He would see it through the ventilator."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What can it mean?"" I gasped."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band', which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"You have come in by train this morning, I see."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""These are very deep waters,"" said he, ""pray go on with your narrative."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Then we shall both come."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""And so do I."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
His smile broadened.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
I know that Miss Stoner has been here.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,"" observed Holmes, shading his eyes."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"You see that we have been as good as our word."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""I have been waiting so eagerly for you,"" she cried, shaking hands with us warmly."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Dr.  Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Why, it's a dummy,"" said he."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""Very strange!"" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""No."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"But there is a cheetah and a baboon."""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""It's a common enough lash."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
It's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is very essential, Miss Stoner,"" said he, ""that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""The matter is too serious for any hesitation."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""But what will you do?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""No, I do not think so."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
At dusk we saw Dr.  Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Can I be of assistance?"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""That is our signal,"" said Holmes, springing to his feet; ""it comes from the middle window."""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Holmes was for the moment as startled as I.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I nodded again.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It struck cold to our hearts, and I stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Then I thought of the whistle.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
The Adventure of the Speckled Band	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""You must not fear,"" said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""I am all attention, madam."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"Pray proceed with your statement."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Helen!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Was your sister dressed?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I have myself some small business matters to attend to.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I cannot think."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I am Dr.  Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,"" continued my companion imperturbably."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr.  Roylott's chamber?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"But I am now sleeping in the middle one."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""My stepfather's business papers."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Oh!"	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"You have seen inside, then?"""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Only once, some years ago."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I assure you that I am in your hands."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Yes, it must be so."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
