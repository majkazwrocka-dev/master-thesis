She is waiting now in the sitting-room.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Now, when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is something very pressing which they have to communicate.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What, then?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"You must have started early, and yet you had a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached the station."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
He does not say so, but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
But I have heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of Surrey."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
The last squire dragged out his existence there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta, where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he established a large practice.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner, the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Of these bedrooms the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third my own.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"Do I make myself plain?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
As I opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had fallen.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It was the band!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"And what conclusions did the coroner come to?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
The walls were carefully sounded, and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was also thoroughly examined, with the same result.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock, though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a speckled band?"""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""He is a hard man,"" she said, ""and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It is probable that he will be away all day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to be there in time for your coming."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""And what do you think of it all, Watson?"" asked Sherlock Holmes, leaning back in his chair."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Dark enough and sinister enough."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable, then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor, the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its place, I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"What has she been saying to you?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I have heard of you before.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
As he spoke he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort, straightened it out again.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It was a perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the heavens.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a very old mansion.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"There it is, where the lady is walking."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
It may stop his gossip.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I have been waiting so eagerly for you,"" she cried, shaking hands with us warmly."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"What will he say when he returns?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Now, on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were unapproachable from that side."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""It goes to the housekeeper's room."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Done about the same time as the bell-rope?"" remarked Holmes."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""Hullo!"	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""The matter is too serious for any hesitation."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

"""Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's death."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""No, I do not think so."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
At dusk we saw Dr.  Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is very kind of you."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"It was so small that a rat could hardly pass through."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran."""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""My dear Holmes!"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""But what harm can there be in that?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Subtle enough and horrible enough."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished, and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Two hours passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Making our way among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I could not hear a sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same state of nervous tension in which I was myself.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Twelve struck, and one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
On the table stood a dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach the ventilator.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
The sight of the safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Very sorry to knock you up, Watson,"" said he, ""but it's the common lot this morning."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""No; a client."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The marks are perfectly fresh.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in your sleep?'"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""'Certainly not."	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
But why?'	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you did not hear it also.'	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"Pray proceed with your statement."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There was something else which she would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
That is important.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which she used."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""You have done wisely,"" said my friend."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""But have you told me all?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"If we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some most important business."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"What are you going to do yourself?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"I shall look forward to seeing you again this afternoon."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I will go when I have said my say."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"See here."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
This incident gives zest to our investigation, however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""All has turned out splendidly."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Hum!"" said he, scratching his chin in some perplexity, ""my theory certainly presents some difficulties."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
These articles, with two small wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""How very absurd!"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"What a strange idea!"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I daresay.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The lash, however, was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I shall most certainly do so."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"I have no doubt that, in spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""The rest you will leave in our hands."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"" said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Perhaps I have."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
The trap drove on, and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"Does not that strike you?"""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I cannot as yet see any connection."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""That is the baboon."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It was a singular sight which met our eyes.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He has died within ten seconds of being bitten.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Let us thrust this creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Such are the true facts of the death of Dr.  Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The presence of the gipsies, and the use of the word 'band', which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Then I thought of the whistle.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the light and attacked it."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The Adventure of the Speckled Band	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my bed.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Good-morning, madam,"" said Holmes cheerily."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"It is terror."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
She raised her veil as she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"You have come in by train this morning, I see."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Your sister is dead, then?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There is no communication between them, but they all open out into the same corridor.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
At eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door and looked back.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It was a wild night.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
My stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to be married in the course of the spring.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"We have a housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily get her out of the way."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Will you not wait and breakfast?"""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me,"" said my companion quietly."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Indeed, Doctor,"" said Holmes blandly."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
My stepdaughter has been here.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I have traced her.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Holmes chuckled heartily.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
I am a dangerous man to fall foul of!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He stepped swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""He seems a very amiable person,"" said Holmes, laughing."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"Dr.  Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab, thrown out on each side.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly caved in, a picture of ruin.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"By the way, there does not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end wall."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the shutter open, but without success.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Won't it ring?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Dr.  Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"You have seen inside, then?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"There is one point which I should wish to determine."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""That is not quite so common, is it?"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Ah, me!	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Then when you hear him retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window, undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Oh, yes, easily."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting-room at the Crown Inn.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr.  Roylott's cigar.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I cannot say that I have."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord, explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance, and that it was possible that we might spend the night there.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Holmes was for the moment as startled as I.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
All was as we had seen it in the daytime.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon the bed beside him.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we had noticed during the day.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow, of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a dangerous pet.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""With the result of driving it through the ventilator."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"I thought, at any rate, that I should call you and give you the chance."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""My name is Sherlock Holmes."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Ha!	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
I am glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick, all-comprehensive glances.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""You know me, then?"""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct,"" said she."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Dr. Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies, and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate, and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents, wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms being in the central block of the buildings.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""'Never,' said I."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps from the next room, perhaps from the lawn.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it.'	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.'"	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""And why?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
The wind was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I sprang from my bed, wrapped a shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked, and revolved slowly upon its hinges.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I stared at it horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Yes, there are nearly always some there."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I was too shaken to go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Miss Roylott, you have not."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Yet we have not a moment to lose.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I see many objections to any such theory."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""Your conversation is most entertaining,"" said he."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over with notes and figures.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Stoke Moran?"" said he."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""There's the village,"" said the driver, pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left; ""but if you want to get to the house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by the foot-path over the fields."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"But I am now sleeping in the middle one."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""No, I never heard of her using it."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where the little opening for the ventilator is."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""That is also quite modern,"" said the lady."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Oh!"	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Let me explain.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if Dr.  Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Do you know, Watson,"" said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness, ""I have really some scruples as to taking you to-night."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I imagine that you saw all that I did."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""It was clamped to the floor."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall be able to strike deeper still.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""That is our signal,"" said Holmes, springing to his feet; ""it comes from the middle window."""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders at any moment.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
For half an hour I sat with straining ears.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where the poison fangs had done their work.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""It is not cold which makes me shiver,"" said the woman in a low voice, changing her seat as requested."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north, and Hampshire in the west."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
You can understand that, living the life which I have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Pray be precise as to details,"" said he."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
The manor-house is, as I have already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Perfectly so."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'"	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"We had no feeling of security unless our doors were locked."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
I knew that it was my sister's voice.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The speckled band!'	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars, which were secured every night.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It is certain, therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""How about poison?"""	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
A month ago, however, a dear friend, whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
I sprang up and lit the lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""By no means."""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
"""I cannot imagine."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters, with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his breadth seemed to span it across from side to side.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I am Dr.  Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Pray take a seat."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I will do nothing of the kind."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Ha!"	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Holmes, the busybody!"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""When you go out close the door, for there is a decided draught."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""See that you keep yourself out of my grip,"" he snarled, and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural prices, not more than 750 pounds.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
My morning's work has not been wasted, since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
And now, Watson, this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
My companion sat in the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the deepest thought.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Good heavens!"" she cried, ""he has followed me, then."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"Now, we must make the best use of our time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any workmen at the moment of our visit.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Ah!"	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"There are windows in it, of course?"""	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the left-hand side of the window.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Why, it's a dummy,"" said he."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""My stepfather's business papers."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""No."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in your room."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Yes, it must be so."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a headache, when your stepfather comes back."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Your presence might be invaluable."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words:  ""The least sound would be fatal to our plans."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I will sit on the side of the bed, and you in that chair."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
The instant that we heard it, Holmes sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell-pull.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I could, however, see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
They say that away down in the village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the sleepers from their beds.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I took a step forward.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Violence does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for another.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I had,"" said he, ""come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He had trained it, probably by the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""It is fear, Mr. Holmes."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""We shall soon set matters right, I have no doubt."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small case-book, which he consulted.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
In the last century, however, four successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition, and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Shortly after our return to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No servant would stay with us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"She was but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already begun to whiten, even as mine has."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
That fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""'No, I have not."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"She smiled back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Always."""	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"""I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Quite so."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""One moment,"" said Holmes, ""are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound?"	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Was your sister dressed?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""This is a very deep business,"" he said at last."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Excellent."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""It is a little cold for the time of the year,"" said Holmes."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""I know you, you scoundrel!"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I know that Miss Stoner has been here.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"And now, Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
An Eley's No.2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I thought it as well,"" said Holmes as we climbed the stile, ""that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or on some definite business."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""So it appears."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
If he is violent, we shall take you away to your aunt's at Harrow.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Then with his lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built firmly into the massive masonry.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""No, it is not even attached to a wire."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Thank you."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"Here is something interesting!"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"But I don't know why it should be tied."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""But what will you do?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Oh, yes, I did."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Now, of course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
A ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the bed dies.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I nodded to show that I had heard.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of an hour.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
How long they seemed, those quarters!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""You see it?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He had ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""And perhaps, after all, it is for the best."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his head.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
In an instant his strange headgear began to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is a swamp adder!"" cried Holmes; ""the deadliest snake in India."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap, and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into the iron safe, which he closed upon it.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
My attention was speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be an advantage.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person it saw.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that which was associated with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""You must not fear,"" said he soothingly, bending forward and patting her forearm."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I think it was before your time, Watson.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the matter."""	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Alas!"" replied our visitor, ""the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous woman."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I am all attention, madam."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
She had a considerable sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him, with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's house.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I am a light sleeper, and it has awakened me.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I could not sleep that night."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
At first I thought that she had not recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""The doctors examined her for it, but without success."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"You are screening your stepfather."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Then we shall both come."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""No, I must go."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I cannot think."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""And so do I."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I traced her!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr.  Grimesby Roylott,"" remarked the driver."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
You must lock yourself up from him to-night.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Exactly so."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Pending the alterations, as I understand."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Holmes refused to examine the third chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her fate.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Where does that bell communicate with?"" he asked at last pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the tassel actually lying upon the pillow."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""It looks newer than the other things?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to this floor."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Very strange!"" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
A camp-bed, a small wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the eye.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Only once, some years ago."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""There isn't a cat in it, for example?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Ah, yes, of course!"	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""What do you make of that, Watson?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
We had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Your life may depend upon your compliance."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I assure you that I am in your hands."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Yes, that is the Crown."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Certainly."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
I think that there was probably some more tangible cause.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""No."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I confess that I felt easier in my mind when, after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I found myself inside the bedroom.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
My companion noiselessly closed the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes round the room.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
I heard a gentle sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the smell grew stronger.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle, soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""You see it, Watson?"" he yelled."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker Street.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Should it prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to follow it from the outset.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as freely as before myself.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It was from her that I had your address.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Ah yes, I recall the case; it was concerned with an opal tiara."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
In a fit of anger, however, caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"He has a passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon, which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I rushed out, calling loudly for my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing-gown.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Could you swear to it?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"It is my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have been deceived."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The chimney is wide, but is barred up by four large staples.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Five little livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed upon the white wrist.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""But what, then, did the gipsies do?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""What has she been saying to you?"" screamed the old man furiously."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"You put me off, do you?"" said our new visitor, taking a step forward and shaking his hunting-crop."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
His smile broadened.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I have seen the will of the deceased wife,"" said he."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It is evident, therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious extent.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""There is some building going on there,"" said Holmes, ""that is where we are going."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner,"" observed Holmes, shading his eyes."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
That is suggestive.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Yes, but very small ones."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down, taking in every detail of the apartment.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining minutely the cracks between the boards.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"For example, what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated with the outside air!"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Your windows would be visible from there?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
They were on the upper floor, and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Then I shall certainly come."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
A moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"He would see it through the ventilator."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The shutters cut off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"The speckled band!"" whispered Holmes."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I can only claim the merit that I instantly reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me, and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I was probably on the right track.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had an Eastern training.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more terrible than the truth.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you sit on the left-hand side of the driver."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Holmes nodded his head.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""The name is familiar to me,"" said he."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Nothing was left save a few acres of ground, and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under a heavy mortgage.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"A series of disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village, and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night?'"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Indeed,"" said Holmes."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
My sister and I, you will recollect, were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Helen!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""No, she was in her night-dress."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""He investigated the case with great care, for Dr.  Roylott's conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Why, what do you mean?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""But I have heard that the crocuses promise well,"" continued my companion imperturbably."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
My friend smiled.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Don't you dare to meddle with my affairs.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force!"	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Each daughter can claim an income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
To me at least there was a strange contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Look there!"" said he."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope, thickening into a grove at the highest point.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"" said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Too narrow for anyone to pass through."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
This is very interesting.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""There are one or two very singular points about this room."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that time."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"With your permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""What's in here?"" he asked, tapping the safe."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"I remember that it was full of papers."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""No, we don't keep a cat."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It's a common enough lash."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is very essential, Miss Stoner,"" said he, ""that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""Very good."	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and if she died from some sudden fright."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"There is a distinct element of danger."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Can I be of assistance?"""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me."""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""You saw the ventilator, too?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more cheerful."""	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It is a nice household,"" he murmured."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I nodded again.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left in darkness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What can it mean?"" I gasped."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""It means that it is all over,"" Holmes answered."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It might or might not bite the occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but sooner or later she must fall a victim.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.  Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she retorted upon me, and I on you."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""What is it, then--a fire?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""There is no mystery, my dear madam,"" said he, smiling."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""Farintosh,"" said he."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
As to reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which suits you best.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old at the time of my mother's re-marriage.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been intensified by his long residence in the tropics.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation.'	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""'Very likely."	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale, there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
By the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
When he reached my sister's side she was unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""These are very deep waters,"" said he, ""pray go on with your narrative."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Yes, all."""	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
"""You have been cruelly used,"" said Holmes."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action."	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
"You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""And you may expect us early in the afternoon."	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
I have myself some small business matters to attend to.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I want to see whether the objections are fatal, or if they may be explained away.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"But what in the name of the devil!"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
A large face, seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin, fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Which of you is Holmes?"" asked this apparition."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""I am not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"You see that we have been as good as our word."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
The central portion was in little better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern, and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep, the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main building to Dr.  Roylott's chamber?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"""There were none."	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
"Now, would you have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters?"""	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Then he did the same with the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Finally he took the bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"I never noticed that before."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""Well, look at this!"""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"But there is a cheetah and a baboon."""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"That is quite settled,"" said he, rising and putting his lens in his pocket."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
It's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you, you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""You speak of danger."	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It could only be a small one, or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
"I deduced a ventilator."""	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
"""The lady could not move her bed."	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
"""Holmes,"" I cried, ""I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at."	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
He has nerve and he has knowledge.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
"""My God!"" I whispered; ""did you see it?"""	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
