Okay, well can’t you just try it one more time Ross? For me? For me?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything. You gotta face it, okay we’re never gonna get along.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

That part was perfect for me! I can't believe I didn't get it!	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
I'm sorry, man.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

Huh?	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL

Wait a second, I could star in it!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Or that.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I can't write!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Y'know I mean I-I-I'm an actor, I don't have the discipline that takes, y'know?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

Soo, ah, Eric, what kind of photography do ya do?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh, mostly fashion, so there may be models here from time to time, I hope that’s cool.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Yes, that is cool. Because I have models here y'know......never.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh, yeah, during the summer, I spend most weekends at my sister’s beach house, which you are welcome to use by the way.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Although, I should probably tell you, she’s a porn star.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Well, listen I ah, still have one more person to ah meet, but unless it turns out to be your sister, I think you’re chances are pretty good.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
All right.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
As bad as that went, I actually enjoyed myself. I think that I’m going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Why don’t you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldn’t have to apologize.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
I would really love it if I could do both.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
All right, I…I have to ask.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
What?	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
What?!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
A hundred and forty-five pounds.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE

Hey ladies! What are you in here for?	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Hey Chandler, what are you doing here?	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Gary, I'm here to report a crime.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL

It is a crime that you and I don't spend more time together.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
What's up?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Well, I heard that you thinking about asking Phoebe to move in with you and I thought maybe, we should have a talk.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Man to uh, me.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Sure. Okay.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Uh, are you crazy? Are you insane? If you live with Phoebe, you two are gonna be y'know, live-living together!	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Yeah, I-I considered that. I just know it would make me happy.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
You mean scared.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
No, I mean happy.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monica’s and she and Chandler had a big fight and they’re not moving in.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
What do you mean, they’re not moving in? They-they’re still moving in right?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
What?! Over a stupid room!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but I’m also really psyched ‘cause I don’t have to move in here!	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Oh no, yeah no, that part’s great!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Shut-out!!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Yeah, get out!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
You guys are always hanging out in my apartment!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh?	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Come on, wussies!	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
All right, ok, I gotta go.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I'm going,  and I'm gone.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
One more game?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh yeah!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
I’m sorry.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Ohhh. Don’t go.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No, I-I-I gotta go.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

Honey, honey, people are looking.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
I don’t care!  I don’t care!!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Yeah, um, I’m, I’m leaving now.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
You can’t leave! I have your shoe!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Good-bye Chandler Bing.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Rachel has those in burgendy.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh, ew!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
What?	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Yeah I know what I wanted to ask you.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Um, can you roll your tongue?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Because I can, and my Mom couldn’t, and I thought y'know, I figured that was something I got from our Dad.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
What, wait, you mean like this?	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Yeah, yeah. You can do it to.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Your not doing it.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Oh right, yeah okay, my Mom could, and I can’t. We don’t have that....	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Where there is no fear of commitment.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Do we have any... Do we have any thoughts here?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Well, I've never been through the tunnel myself, 'cause as I understand it, you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car, right.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
But, it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else, you know, face your fear.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
It have a fear of heights, you go to the top of the building!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
If you're afraid of bugs.....get a bug.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Right.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
In this case, you have a fear of commitment, so I say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Amazingly, that makes sense.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
You think?	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Oh, yeah. Go for it man, jump off the high dive, stare down the barrel of the gun, pee into the wind!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Yeah, Joe, I assure you if I'm staring down the barrel of a gun, I'm pretty much peeing every which way.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Hey!  Hey!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Hi!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Hi! Look! I got our pictures developed from Rockefeller Center.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Oh great! Hey-hey Joey, do you want to check out pictures of me and Mona ice skating?	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Oh uh, ordinarily I would love too, but I am just swamped right now.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Hey where-where are the pictures that creepy pretzel vendor took of us together?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh yeah, probably at the end.  Oh my God! He only took pictures of my breasts!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

Okay. Okay, here’s a good one of us.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Wow!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
That is a good one!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Wow, it looks like a, like a holiday card y’know, with the tree in the middle and the skaters and the snow.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Y’know, every year I say I’m gonna send out holiday cards and I never do it.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Do you wanna, do you wanna send this one out together?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Together? Like-like to people?	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE

Oh, I gotta get to work. So call me later?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Uh sure, sure.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Bye guys.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I mean, I don’t feel like I even have a girlfriend anymore.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
You want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you’ve got a girlfriend?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Is this about Mark?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh my God.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Okay, it’s not, it’s not.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh my God. I cannot keep having this same fight with you Ross! Look, urrgh, maybe we should take a break.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Fine, you’re right.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Let’s ah, let’s take a break,  let’s cool off, okay, let’s get some frozen yoghurt, or something..	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
No. A break from us.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Bing! We’re all set for tonight, 8 o’clock.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Oh uh, as it turns out, we can’t do it. Monica has to work.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
Oh, my ex-wife didn’t work, unless you call turning into her mother work. Fine. Tomorrow night then.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Oh uh well tomorrow’s no good for her either.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh? Why not?	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
It’s the semi-finals…of her…botchy ball tournament.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
What’s going on Bing? Does uh, your wife have a problem with me or something?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Well now-now you’re just talking crazy.	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
So why can’t the three of us go out together?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Because uh…we-we…we split up. Monica and I split up. Hold me.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Good God Bing I…well I can’t say I’m altogether surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
And the way she looked at me, pure lust.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Y’know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something. Can I choke ya?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Bing my boy, we’re gonna get you over this.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Now here’s the plan, grab your coat, we’re going to a strip club.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE
Oh no-no-no, Monica would freak.  But to hell with that bitch.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Look at you, all sweet and innocent, sleeping like an angel...    with Emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
It's    okay, Emma, you stay asleep.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
: Step away from the crib,    I have a weapon!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
It's okay, it's okay Rach, it's me. Put down the scrunchy.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
What are you doing?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Well, I heard Emma stirring, so I came to make sure she could    reach Hugsy.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh, oh thanks. Alright well, now that I'm up I'm going to go    to the bathroom.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
There you go sweetie...     This isn't over.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Did he call?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
No. Sorry.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Why?! Why?! He said he’d call. Why hasn’t he called?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Maybe he’s intimated by really smart, strong, successful women.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Sophie, would you please climb out of my butt. Why hasn’t he called, Rachel? Why?	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Okay, okay. Umm, well ah, maybe he, maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Awkward? Why should he feel awkward?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
The only person that should feel awkward is you, and you didn’t tell him not to call me, did you?	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for, there are always ways to fix...that.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
And you’re upset because you didn’t make your best friend cry?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I mean, all I’m asking for is just a little emotion!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Is that too much to ask after six years?!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I mean what?	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I mean do we not have as much fun?!	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Don’t I deserve a few tears?!!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Hey!	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE

It’s like the end of an era!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No more J-man and Channie’s!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Do I know why we’re rushing?	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
Yeah, y'know the ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Well it turns out she ah, she wants to get back together with me.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL

Hey!	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
All that stuff you said about true love, you were right, I mean, we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad!	NEGATIVE	POSITIVE
And that picture of Chi-Chi with her mischievous grin.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
And what you said about Nana.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Ohh, yeah she really would’ve wanted to be there.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
And you know what?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I think she was.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh good God, Ross! How the hell do you do it?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
You forget how many great songs Heart had.	POSITIVE	NEUTRAL
Yeah.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but I’m not even sure I got it.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
What, you didn’t get it? The doctor is a monkey.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
And monkeys can’t write out prescriptions.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Your joke? Well, I think ‘the Hef’ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I can’t find garbage bags!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Oh, I think I saw some in here.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
What is it?!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I don’t know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, it’ll die.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I can’t believe we’re living here!	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
You still haven’t told Rachel you weren’t really  proposing?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she  took her breast out.	POSITIVE	NEGATIVE
Joey, you have to tell her what’s going on! And what did it  look like?!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
I didn’t look at it. Stupid baby’s head was blocking most of  it.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Look, it’s not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I  don’t want to hurt her.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Okay, look, just do it gently.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
You’re right.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
You’re right.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I-I’ll go tell her now before Ross  finds out and I’ll be gentle.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I can do that.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
I am a gentle person.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh, by the  way.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Two people screwing in there  if you want to check that out.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Okay, umm, it's this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and umm, it takes place on like these really creepy mores in England.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Which	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here , Rachel Green?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Umm, well I would have to say that it's a, it's tragic love story.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Well, that's sort of a given, but yes. Anyone else?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-the uh, wildness of the mores, which	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Excellent! What Rachel has shrewdly observed here	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
You completely stole my answer!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

And I-I am just trying to figure out why.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Any luck?	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Well, yeah, y’know how Ross and I were on again, off again, on again, off again?	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE

Again. Y’know what? I think we all did.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Hey!	POSITIVE	POSITIVE

You're not an artist.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL

Y’know?	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don’t really seem to care too much that you’re leaving.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
Well, we’re really not that close.  Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
On no! No! It’s not good-bye, I’m not leaving until you get on that plane.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No, I’m afraid I won’t be able to make love as well as him.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

Yes, and I was saying the actual words.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
So big deal, so Joey’s had a lot of girlfriends, it doesn’t mean he’s great in bed.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
We share a wall! So either he’s great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Sweetie, with you it’s gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, ‘cause you-you guys are in love.	NEUTRAL	POSITIVE

I thought I was making him filet mignon?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
And then you realised if you  bitched about it, then you  would stop cooking, and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.	POSITIVE	POSITIVE
Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, don’t worry about it!	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE

Although y’know, he-he’s a private guy.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Y’know, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
That’s easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that won’t open.	NEGATIVE	NEUTRAL
So what are you saying.  I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?	NEGATIVE	NEGATIVE
No that’s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL
Hi honey.	NEUTRAL	NEUTRAL

I don’t care which pot is regular and which pot is decaf, I don’t care where the tray spot is, I just don’t care, this is not what I want to do.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
So I don’t think I should do it anymore.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
I’m gonna give you my weeks notice.	NEUTRAL	NEGATIVE
